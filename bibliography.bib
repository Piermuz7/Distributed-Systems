abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are distributed systems where each user shares his resources and cooperates with other users. These networks are designed over IP-based infrastructure. The resources of each user in these networks are shared in a distributed way on a trust based mechanism. P2P networks have some unique characteristics like scalability and cost efficiency, which separate these networks from other distributed networks. These networks are mainly used for resource sharing. However, resource searching in this type of networks is not centrally controlled in nature. Further poor search scalability is another limitation of these networks. Chord like or chord-based protocols used in the search operations in P2P networks utilize a finger table to shorten the query search length. We exploit the finger forwarding mechanism in our proposed scheme which further reduces the resource’s search path length. We propose a last finger search table in addition to finger table to enhance the file lookup performance in the structured P2P networks. The proposed scheme reduces the lookup path and increases search efficiency as compared to the existing chord and binary search routing equivalent schemes.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

abstract={Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or hostile remote computing elements. To resist these threats, many such systems employ redundancy. However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these ``Sybil attacks'' is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.},
