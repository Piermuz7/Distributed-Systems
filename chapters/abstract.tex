    In this paper, we explore the Chord framework, a decentralized protocol designed for \gls{p2p} systems.
    We begin with an introduction to distributed systems, highlighting the evolution towards \gls{p2p} architectures.
    We then delve into the specifics of the Chord system, explaining its core mechanisms and algorithms.
    Following this, we examine various systems and applications built on top of Chord, showcasing its versatility and robustness.
    Finally, we conclude with a summary of Chord's contributions to the field of distributed systems and its potential for future developments.
